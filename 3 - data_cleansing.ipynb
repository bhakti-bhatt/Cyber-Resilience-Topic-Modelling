There are several methods of responding to a network intrusion, but they all require precise identification of the attack. This paper presents an approach of intrusion detection by Resilient Backpropagation algorithm, a direct adaptive method for faster learning. Keywords: Intrusion Detection, Anomaly Detection, Misuse Detection, RPROP (Resilient Backpropagation), Neural Networks, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), Learning Algorithm, Dataset. 1.0. Introduction Intrusion detection systems are the main tools for providing security in computer and network system. The dependency of private and government organizations is increasing on their computer networks and protecting theses system from attack is serious. A single intrusion of a computer network can result in loss or the reliability of network became unsure. Therefore a mechanism is presented here that will detect network intrusion in a precise way by using the power of RPROP learning algorithm [1]. This paper is divided into three primary areas. The first section provides an overview of intrusion detection and neural networks. The second section presents our architecture of neural networks in the identification of attacks against a network. Finally, the results of tests conducted on a neural network, which was designed as a proof of concept, are also presented and the areas of future research that are being conducted in this area are also discussed. 2.0. Intrusion Detection Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are the most important tools for providing security in computer and networks. There are numerous methods of responding to a network intrusion, but they all require the precise and timely identification of the attack [2]. Dr. Dorothy Denning proposed an intrusion Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 524 detection model in 1987 which became a landmark in the research in this area. The model which she proposed forms the fundamental core of most intrusion detection methodologies in use today [3]. The intrusion diction systems can be classified into three categories as host based, network based and vulnerability assessment [4]. There are many approaches that are being used to accomplish the desirable elements of an intrusion detection system like anomaly detection, misuse detection, combined anomaly/misuse detection, pattern recognition and networking monitoring. 2.1. Neural Networks An artificial neural network consists of a collection of processing elements that are highly interconnected and transform a set of inputs to a set of desired outputs. The result of the transformation is determined by the characteristics of the elements and the weights associated with the interconnections among them. By modifying the connections between the nodes the network is able to adapt to the desired outputs [5, 6]. The application of neural network in intrusion detection is an on going area. It offers the potential to resolve a number of the problems encountered by the other current approaches to intrusion detection. Artificial neural networks are alternatives. The first advantage in the utilization of a neural network in the intrusion detection would be the flexibility that the network would provide. . A neural network would be capable of analyzing the data from the network, even if the data is incomplete or distorted. Similarly, the network would possess the ability to conduct an analysis with data in a non-linear fashion. Further, because some attacks may be conducted against the network in a coordinated attack by multiple attackers, the ability to process data from a number of sources in a non-linear fashion is especially important. The natural speed of neural networks is another benefit of this approach. However, the most important advantage of neural networks in intrusion detection is the ability of the neural network to \"learn\" the characteristics of attacks and identify instances that have been observed before by the network. 3.0. Architecture The architecture of our mechanism consists of one input, two hidden and one output layer with 41,14,9 and 2 neurons. The input layer consists of 41 neurons because the Kddcup data set contains 41 fields for a network packet to be used for intrusion detection training [7, 8, 9, 10]. There is no exact formula for the selection of hidden layers so we can make it by comparison and select which one is best [11]. For choosing best set of hidden layers and its no. of neuron a comparison is made for many cases and best one is selected that is two hidden layers with 14 and 9 neurons. The architecture for normal and attacked scenario is shown. Figure 1 525 Iftikhar Ahmad, Sami Ullah Swati and Sajjad Mohsin The architecture used in our mechanism is feedforward. If the output of neural network is nearest to 0 and 1 then this packet will be considered as normal. Figure 2 If the output of neural network is nearest to 1 and 0 then this packet will be considered as bad means it involves some intrusion. Our mechanism consists of two phases. One is training of the net while second is testing of the net. The training phase is shown in the following figure. Figure 3 The training architecture consists of layers. The Layer contains units or nodes called neurons. A neuron is a processing element that has an activation function to produce its output. The layers of the net are interconnected by synapse. The Layer object is the basic element that forms the neural network. It is composed of neurons, all having the same characteristics. This component transfers the input pattern to the output pattern by executing a transfer function. The output pattern is sent to a vector of Synapse objects attached to the layer's output. It is the active element of a neural net. The Layer applies a sigmoid transfer function to its input patterns. Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 526 Input layer The Input layer takes input from the input file that contains dataset for training of the net. The sample dataset is randomly selected from Kddcup dataset. The 80% from the samples are used for training while others are used for testing the net. The row of the dataset is called a pattern representing an instance of the input dataset. The neural network reads and elaborates sequentially all the input rows and for each one it generates an output pattern representing the outcome of the entire process. Hidden layers We use two hidden layers in our developed mechanism representing a good non-linear element of the neural network. The sigmoid layers are used as hidden layers of the net. It can also be used to build whatever layer of a neural network. These take inputs from the outputs of the input layer and apply its activation function. The output is sent to the output layer. Output layer The Output components allow a neural network to write output patterns in a file that are used for analysis of intrusion. Teacher layer The function of this component (the TeacherSynapse) is to calculate the difference between the output of the neural network and a desired value obtained from some external data source. The calculated difference is injected backward into the neural network starting from the output layer of the net, so each component can process the error pattern to modify the internal connections by applying the learning algorithm. The Synapse The Synapse represents the connection between two layers, permitting a pattern to be passed from one layer to another. The Synapse is also the ‘memory’ of a neural network. During the training process the weigh of each connection is modified according the learning algorithm. The layers are fully connected with each other. For this purpose FullSynapse object is used that connects all the nodes of a layer with all the nodes of the other layer, as showed above in the figures: Training We used Resilient Backpropagation algorithm for training of the net because it converges very quickly. It uses only the sign of the backpropagated gradient to change the biases/weights of the net. Hence it is local adaptive learning scheme and has the possibility to escape from local minima. The basic principle is to eliminate the harmful influence of the size of partial derivative on the weight step [12, 13, 14, 15]. The training phase consists of the following steps. 1. The Feedforward of input training pattern 2. The calculation and backpropagation of associated error 3. The adjustment of the weights The aim of training means to get reasonable (good) responses to input that is similar but not identical. Testing After training, the net only involves computation of the feedforward phase. The structure of the testing net is shown in the figure. 527 Iftikhar Ahmad, Sami Ullah Swati and Sajjad Mohsin Figure 4 It consists of one Input, two hidden and one output layers. The output of the net is saved in file that will be used for intrusion analysis. If the global error value is nearest to 0 and 1 then it is normal packet otherwise consider as attack. The net is implemented in Java by using JOONE API. The interface of the simulation is shown in the figure. Figure 5 The summary of report generated by the simulation is shown in the following figure. Summary: No. of Total Packets= 16 No. of Normal Packets= 5 No of Attacked Packets= 11 Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 528 Figure 6 The different reports are generated by the simulation for several attacks and then find out its accuracy. 4.0. Results After training, the net is tested for different types of network attacks. A comparative analysis of various attacks is shown in the following tables.

Conclusion Our implemented mechanism shows best performance as compared to other NN approaches as shown in the following figure [7, 16]. Figure 7 The focus of our research was to increase accurate intrusion detection rate. Once attack is detected then there are several available methods to block network intrusion. 6.0. Future Research The efficient intrusion detection mechanism can be developed that have very low error rate, high learning rate and quick intrusion detection by using with other neural networks in the form of hybrid architecture. 8993.590.795.93859095100Detection rateMSOMSART-1ART-2RPROPNN IDS ApprochesComparison in performance Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 530 \n"

There are several methods of responding to a network intrusion, but they all require precise identification of the attack. This paper presents an approach of intrusion detection by Resilient Backpropagation algorithm, a direct adaptive method for faster learning. Keywords: Intrusion Detection, Anomaly Detection, Misuse Detection, RPROP (Resilient Backpropagation), Neural Networks, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), Learning Algorithm, Dataset. 1.0. Introduction Intrusion detection systems are the main tools for providing security in computer and network system. The dependency of private and government organizations is increasing on their computer networks and protecting theses system from attack is serious. A single intrusion of a computer network can result in loss or the reliability of network became unsure. Therefore a mechanism is presented here that will detect network intrusion in a precise way by using the power of RPROP learning algorithm [1]. This paper is divided into three primary areas. The first section provides an overview of intrusion detection and neural networks. The second section presents our architecture of neural networks in the identification of attacks against a network. Finally, the results of tests conducted on a neural network, which was designed as a proof of concept, are also presented and the areas of future research that are being conducted in this area are also discussed. 2.0. Intrusion Detection Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are the most important tools for providing security in computer and networks. There are numerous methods of responding to a network intrusion, but they all require the precise and timely identification of the attack [2]. Dr. Dorothy Denning proposed an intrusion Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 524 detection model in 1987 which became a landmark in the research in this area. The model which she proposed forms the fundamental core of most intrusion detection methodologies in use today [3]. The intrusion diction systems can be classified into three categories as host based, network based and vulnerability assessment [4]. There are many approaches that are being used to accomplish the desirable elements of an intrusion detection system like anomaly detection, misuse detection, combined anomaly/misuse detection, pattern recognition and networking monitoring. 2.1. Neural Networks An artificial neural network consists of a collection of processing elements that are highly interconnected and transform a set of inputs to a set of desired outputs. The result of the transformation is determined by the characteristics of the elements and the weights associated with the interconnections among them. By modifying the connections between the nodes the network is able to adapt to the desired outputs [5, 6]. The application of neural network in intrusion detection is an on going area. It offers the potential to resolve a number of the problems encountered by the other current approaches to intrusion detection. Artificial neural networks are alternatives. The first advantage in the utilization of a neural network in the intrusion detection would be the flexibility that the network would provide. . A neural network would be capable of analyzing the data from the network, even if the data is incomplete or distorted. Similarly, the network would possess the ability to conduct an analysis with data in a non-linear fashion. Further, because some attacks may be conducted against the network in a coordinated attack by multiple attackers, the ability to process data from a number of sources in a non-linear fashion is especially important. The natural speed of neural networks is another benefit of this approach. However, the most important advantage of neural networks in intrusion detection is the ability of the neural network to \"learn\" the characteristics of attacks and identify instances that have been observed before by the network. 3.0. Architecture The architecture of our mechanism consists of one input, two hidden and one output layer with 41,14,9 and 2 neurons. The input layer consists of 41 neurons because the Kddcup data set contains 41 fields for a network packet to be used for intrusion detection training [7, 8, 9, 10]. There is no exact formula for the selection of hidden layers so we can make it by comparison and select which one is best [11]. For choosing best set of hidden layers and its no. of neuron a comparison is made for many cases and best one is selected that is two hidden layers with 14 and 9 neurons. The architecture for normal and attacked scenario is shown. Figure 1 525 Iftikhar Ahmad, Sami Ullah Swati and Sajjad Mohsin The architecture used in our mechanism is feedforward. If the output of neural network is nearest to 0 and 1 then this packet will be considered as normal. Figure 2 If the output of neural network is nearest to 1 and 0 then this packet will be considered as bad means it involves some intrusion. Our mechanism consists of two phases. One is training of the net while second is testing of the net. The training phase is shown in the following figure. Figure 3 The training architecture consists of layers. The Layer contains units or nodes called neurons. A neuron is a processing element that has an activation function to produce its output. The layers of the net are interconnected by synapse. The Layer object is the basic element that forms the neural network. It is composed of neurons, all having the same characteristics. This component transfers the input pattern to the output pattern by executing a transfer function. The output pattern is sent to a vector of Synapse objects attached to the layer's output. It is the active element of a neural net. The Layer applies a sigmoid transfer function to its input patterns. Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 526 Input layer The Input layer takes input from the input file that contains dataset for training of the net. The sample dataset is randomly selected from Kddcup dataset. The 80% from the samples are used for training while others are used for testing the net. The row of the dataset is called a pattern representing an instance of the input dataset. The neural network reads and elaborates sequentially all the input rows and for each one it generates an output pattern representing the outcome of the entire process. Hidden layers We use two hidden layers in our developed mechanism representing a good non-linear element of the neural network. The sigmoid layers are used as hidden layers of the net. It can also be used to build whatever layer of a neural network. These take inputs from the outputs of the input layer and apply its activation function. The output is sent to the output layer. Output layer The Output components allow a neural network to write output patterns in a file that are used for analysis of intrusion. Teacher layer The function of this component (the TeacherSynapse) is to calculate the difference between the output of the neural network and a desired value obtained from some external data source. The calculated difference is injected backward into the neural network starting from the output layer of the net, so each component can process the error pattern to modify the internal connections by applying the learning algorithm. The Synapse The Synapse represents the connection between two layers, permitting a pattern to be passed from one layer to another. The Synapse is also the ‘memory’ of a neural network. During the training process the weigh of each connection is modified according the learning algorithm. The layers are fully connected with each other. For this purpose FullSynapse object is used that connects all the nodes of a layer with all the nodes of the other layer, as showed above in the figures: Training We used Resilient Backpropagation algorithm for training of the net because it converges very quickly. It uses only the sign of the backpropagated gradient to change the biases/weights of the net. Hence it is local adaptive learning scheme and has the possibility to escape from local minima. The basic principle is to eliminate the harmful influence of the size of partial derivative on the weight step [12, 13, 14, 15]. The training phase consists of the following steps. 1. The Feedforward of input training pattern 2. The calculation and backpropagation of associated error 3. The adjustment of the weights The aim of training means to get reasonable (good) responses to input that is similar but not identical. Testing After training, the net only involves computation of the feedforward phase. The structure of the testing net is shown in the figure. 527 Iftikhar Ahmad, Sami Ullah Swati and Sajjad Mohsin Figure 4 It consists of one Input, two hidden and one output layers. The output of the net is saved in file that will be used for intrusion analysis. If the global error value is nearest to 0 and 1 then it is normal packet otherwise consider as attack. The net is implemented in Java by using JOONE API. The interface of the simulation is shown in the figure. Figure 5 The summary of report generated by the simulation is shown in the following figure. Summary: No. of Total Packets= 16 No. of Normal Packets= 5 No of Attacked Packets= 11 Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 528 Figure 6 The different reports are generated by the simulation for several attacks and then find out its accuracy. 4.0. Results After training, the net is tested for different types of network attacks. A comparative analysis of various attacks is shown in the following tables.

Conclusion Our implemented mechanism shows best performance as compared to other NN approaches as shown in the following figure [7, 16]. Figure 7 The focus of our research was to increase accurate intrusion detection rate. Once attack is detected then there are several available methods to block network intrusion. 6.0. Future Research The efficient intrusion detection mechanism can be developed that have very low error rate, high learning rate and quick intrusion detection by using with other neural networks in the form of hybrid architecture. 8993.590.795.93859095100Detection rateMSOMSART-1ART-2RPROPNN IDS ApprochesComparison in performance Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 530 \n"

It offers the potential to resolve a number of the problems encountered by the other current approaches to intrusion detection. Artificial neural networks are alternatives. The first advantage in the utilization of a neural network in the intrusion detection would be the flexibility that the network would provide. . A neural network would be capable of analyzing the data from the network, even if the data is incomplete or distorted. Similarly, the network would possess the ability to conduct an analysis with data in a non-linear fashion. Further, because some attacks may be conducted against the network in a coordinated attack by multiple attackers, the ability to process data from a number of sources in a non-linear fashion is especially important. The natural speed of neural networks is another benefit of this approach. However, the most important advantage of neural networks in intrusion detection is the ability of the neural network to \"learn\" the characteristics of attacks and identify instances that have been observed before by the network. 3.0. Architecture The architecture of our mechanism consists of one input, two hidden and one output layer with 41,14,9 and 2 neurons. The input layer consists of 41 neurons because the Kddcup data set contains 41 fields for a network packet to be used for intrusion detection training [7, 8, 9, 10]. There is no exact formula for the selection of hidden layers so we can make it by comparison and select which one is best [11]. For choosing best set of hidden layers and its no. of neuron a comparison is made for many cases and best one is selected that is two hidden layers with 14 and 9 neurons. The architecture for normal and attacked scenario is shown. Figure 1 525 Iftikhar Ahmad, Sami Ullah Swati and Sajjad Mohsin The architecture used in our mechanism is feedforward. If the output of neural network is nearest to 0 and 1 then this packet will be considered as normal. Figure 2 If the output of neural network is nearest to 1 and 0 then this packet will be considered as bad means it involves some intrusion. Our mechanism consists of two phases. One is training of the net while second is testing of the net. The training phase is shown in the following figure. Figure 3 The training architecture consists of layers. The Layer contains units or nodes called neurons. A neuron is a processing element that has an activation function to produce its output. The layers of the net are interconnected by synapse. The Layer object is the basic element that forms the neural network. It is composed of neurons, all having the same characteristics. This component transfers the input pattern to the output pattern by executing a transfer function. The output pattern is sent to a vector of Synapse objects attached to the layer's output. It is the active element of a neural net. The Layer applies a sigmoid transfer function to its input patterns. Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 526 Input layer The Input layer takes input from the input file that contains dataset for training of the net. The sample dataset is randomly selected from Kddcup dataset. The 80% from the samples are used for training while others are used for testing the net. The row of the dataset is called a pattern representing an instance of the input dataset. The neural network reads and elaborates sequentially all the input rows and for each one it generates an output pattern representing the outcome of the entire process. Hidden layers We use two hidden layers in our developed mechanism representing a good non-linear element of the neural network. The sigmoid layers are used as hidden layers of the net. It can also be used to build whatever layer of a neural network. These take inputs from the outputs of the input layer and apply its activation function. The output is sent to the output layer. Output layer The Output components allow a neural network to write output patterns in a file that are used for analysis of intrusion. Teacher layer The function of this component (the TeacherSynapse) is to calculate the difference between the output of the neural network and a desired value obtained from some external data source. The calculated difference is injected backward into the neural network starting from the output layer of the net, so each component can process the error pattern to modify the internal connections by applying the learning algorithm. The Synapse The Synapse represents the connection between two layers, permitting a pattern to be passed from one layer to another. The Synapse is also the ‘memory’ of a neural network. During the training process the weigh of each connection is modified according the learning algorithm. The layers are fully connected with each other. For this purpose FullSynapse object is used that connects all the nodes of a layer with all the nodes of the other layer, as showed above in the figures: Training We used Resilient Backpropagation algorithm for training of the net because it converges very quickly. It uses only the sign of the backpropagated gradient to change the biases/weights of the net. Hence it is local adaptive learning scheme and has the possibility to escape from local minima. The basic principle is to eliminate the harmful influence of the size of partial derivative on the weight step [12, 13, 14, 15]. The training phase consists of the following steps. 1. The Feedforward of input training pattern 2. The calculation and backpropagation of associated error 3. The adjustment of the weights The aim of training means to get reasonable (good) responses to input that is similar but not identical. Testing After training, the net only involves computation of the feedforward phase. The structure of the testing net is shown in the figure. 527 Iftikhar Ahmad, Sami Ullah Swati and Sajjad Mohsin Figure 4 It consists of one Input, two hidden and one output layers. The output of the net is saved in file that will be used for intrusion analysis. If the global error value is nearest to 0 and 1 then it is normal packet otherwise consider as attack. The net is implemented in Java by using JOONE API. The interface of the simulation is shown in the figure. Figure 5 The summary of report generated by the simulation is shown in the following figure. Summary: No. of Total Packets= 16 No. of Normal Packets= 5 No of Attacked Packets= 11 Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) 528 Figure 6 The different reports are generated by the simulation for several attacks and then find out its accuracy. 4.0.

Conclusion Our implemented mechanism shows best performance as compared to other NN approaches as shown in the following figure [7, 16]. Figure 7 The focus of our research was to increase accurate intrusion detection rate. Once attack is detected then there are several available methods to block network intrusion. 6.0.

The reliance on communication networks introduces potential cyber security issues into MGs. However, such attacks are difﬁcult to be detected when a global situa- tional awareness is lacking in distributed systems. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of cyber-attacks on communication links, local controllers, and master controller, which would drive MGs away from optimal operating points. We propose a cyber-attack resilient distributed control strategy in which each participant can detect and isolate corrupted links and controllers in a timely and economic fashion. The proposed control strategy is effec- tive against time-varying attack signals and successive attacks while retaining the MG operational merits. The proposed con- trol strategy is examined for different types of attacks. In this case, we consider various operating conditions and apply the time-domain PSCAD/EMTDC to the simulation and analyses of two MG systems.

Considering variable DERs and loads, the reliance on communication networks will be inevitable for realizing the coordinated con- trol of diversiﬁed participators []. Thus, MG is considered as a cyber-physical system which requires sophisticated network technologies to handle massive adoptions of communication, computation, and control devices []. Conventionally, a central master controller (MC) is deployed to process data collected from participating DERs and send operational set points to participants. With the increasing num- ber of participating DERs, the central MC would require extremely fast and reliable communication and computa- tion capabilities for realizing real-time data collections and processing. Any failures in communication and control infras- tructures would affect the overall MG performance in terms of efﬁciency and stability []. \n"

Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) Iftikhar Ahmad Department of Computer Sciences COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan Sami Ullah Swati Department of Computer Sciences COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan Sajjad Mohsin Department of Computer Sciences COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan Abstract The accurate detection of computer and network system intrusions has always been an elusive aim for system administrator and information security researchers. There are several methods of responding to a network intrusion, but they all require precise identification of the attack. This paper presents an approach of intrusion detection by Resilient Backpropagation algorithm, a direct adaptive method for faster learning. Keywords: Intrusion Detection, Anomaly Detection, Misuse Detection, RPROP (Resilient Backpropagation), Neural Networks, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), Learning Algorithm, Dataset. .. Introduction Intrusion detection systems are the main tools for providing security in computer and network system. The dependency of private and government organizations is increasing on their computer networks and protecting theses system from attack is serious. A single intrusion of a computer network can result in loss or the reliability of network became unsure. Therefore a mechanism is presented here that will detect network intrusion in a precise way by using the power of RPROP learning algorithm []. This paper is divided into three primary areas. The first section provides an overview of intrusion detection and neural networks. The second section presents our architecture of neural networks in the identification of attacks against a network. Finally, the results of tests conducted on a neural network, which was designed as a proof of concept, are also presented and the areas of future research that are being conducted in this area are also discussed. .. Intrusion Detection Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are the most important tools for providing security in computer and networks. There are numerous methods of responding to a network intrusion, but they all require the precise and timely identification of the attack []. Dr. Dorothy Denning proposed an intrusion Intrusions Detection Mechanism by Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP)  detection model in  which became a landmark in the research in this area. The model which she proposed forms the fundamental core of most intrusion detection methodologies in use today []. The intrusion diction systems can be classified into three categories as host based, network based and vulnerability assessment []. There are many approaches that are being used to accomplish the desirable elements of an intrusion detection system like anomaly detection, misuse detection, combined anomaly/misuse detection, pattern recognition and networking monitoring. .. Neural Networks An artificial neural network consists of a collection of processing elements that are highly interconnected and transform a set of inputs to a set of desired outputs. The result of the transformation is determined by the characteristics of the elements and the weights associated with the interconnections among them. By modifying the connections between the nodes the network is able to adapt to the desired outputs [, ]. The application of neural network in intrusion detection is an on going area.
